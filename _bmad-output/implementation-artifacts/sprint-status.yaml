# CRITICAL ISSUES (Process Improvements Needed)
# ============================================================
# ISSUE-001: DEV Agent not updating documentation files
#   - Date: 2026-01-20
#   - Issue: DEV Agent completed Story 7-7 implementation but did not
#     update sprint-status.yaml to reflect 'done' status
#   - Impact: Tracking dashboard shows incorrect progress
#   - Action: SM must verify sprint-status.yaml updates after each story
#   - Resolution: Added mandatory doc update to code review checklist
